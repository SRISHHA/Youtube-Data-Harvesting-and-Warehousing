# Youtube-Data-Harvesting-and-Warehousing
This project aims to build a user friendly streamlit application which helps users to scrape data from Youtube using Google API when users provide the Channelid and then migrates to MongoDB. Finally it performs some Data Analysis by migration of Data to SQL.Visualisations are also performed with data in order to make it more insightful using matplotlib and seaborn.

This Project actually performs ETL --->Extract,Transform,Load
1.Extraction of data is done by Google API to scrape data about that particular Youtube Channel
2.Transformation Of Data involves migration of data into MongoDB
3.Loading the data into SQL and performing Data Analysis


FLOW OF PROJECT
1.Collection Of Youtube Data through Google API.
2.Migration Of Data into MongoDB.
3.Transformation of Data from MongoDB into SQL and performing Data Analysis.
To make it more User-Freindly this project makes use of Streamlit to run it as a web Application locally.
